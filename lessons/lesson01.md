The purpose of this tutorial is to show how to run U-Boot and Linux in QEMU and to list necessary resources all in one place. Because the code will be running on emulated machine, there is no need for real hardware. The chosen architecture is `RISC-V`.

This tutorial is inspired by and heavily followed the contents of this amazing talk: [Embedded Linux from scratch in RISC-V](https://mirror.cyberbits.eu/fosdem/2021/D.embedded/linux_from_scratch_on_risc_v.webm).

A fairly simple way is illustrated in this tutorial to run U-Boot and Linux kernel in QEMU. Advanced users may try different options when configuring/building various stuff throughout the tutorial.
